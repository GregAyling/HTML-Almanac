				The LSWR 415 class is a steam tank locomotive of 4-4-2T wheel arrangement, with the trailing wheels forming the basis of its "Radial Tank" moniker. 
				It was designed by William Adams and introduced in 1882 for service on the London and South Western Railway (LSWR).
                Originally rostered for suburban traffic, the class was soon displaced to the countryside by Dugald Drummond's M7 class. 
				Most of the class was scrapped around the end of the First World War, and further decreases meant that all of them were due to be withdrawn by 1929. 
				However, the class was noted for its long service on the Lyme Regis branch line, and three members of this long obsolete class were utilised on this duty until 1962, when suitable replacements became available. 
                One has survived and can be found on the Bluebell Railway.

				The London, Brighton and South Coast Railway C2 class was a class of 0-6-0 steam locomotives, intended for heavy freight trains. 
				In January 1891 Robert Billinton was given authority to build ten new 0-6-0 freight locomotives, to supplement Stroudley's C1 class of 1882-7. 
				However, at the time, Brighton works was fully committed building Billinton's various classes of radial tanks and so tenders were sought from outside contractors. 
				Ultimately the Vulcan Foundry agreed to construct these ten locomotives, and further orders were received at intervals until 55 had been purchased by February 1902. 
				The class were therefore nicknamed 'Vulcans'.
				The new class were not as powerful as their predecessors but were found to be both reliable and also capable of running at speed, 
				thereby enabling them to be used on secondary passenger and excursion duties.
				As a result, a further ten were ordered from Vulcan Foundry, which were delivered 1893-4, and twenty five delivered 1900-1902.

				The London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Fowler 3F 0-6-0T is a class of steam locomotive, often known as Jinty. 
				They represent the ultimate development of the Midland Railway's six-coupled tank engines.
				Design of this class was based on rebuilds by Henry Fowler of the Midland Railway 2441 Class introduced in 1899 by Samuel Waite Johnson. 
				These rebuilds featured a Belpaire firebox and improved cab. 
				422 Jinties were built between 1924 and 1931; this class was just one of the Midland designs used on an ongoing basis by the LMS. 
				The locomotives were built by the ex-L&YR Horwich Works and the private firms Bagnall's, Beardmores, Hunslet, North British and the Vulcan Foundry.

				From the 1920s London was surrounded by a number of large freight Marshalling yards, 
				where long-distance freight trains were brought and re-organised into new trains for onward transmission to their destinations. 
				Three of these yards, at Feltham, Norwood and Hither Green, were operated by the Southern Railway. 
				The requirement for a fast freight transfer locomotive between these yards, and across London to other railway yards, 
				provided a challenge for Richard Maunsell. 
				The electrified suburban lines were busy with commuter traffic which took priority over freight workings, 
				and the London network abounded with junctions and signal stops. 
				The design brief called for a powerful locomotive with good acceleration and adhesion, 
				one that was able to climb the steep gradients over the flying junctions that were to be found all over the Southern Railway's London network. 
				The ability to operate over tight curves and be able to pull away from a standstill on the aforementioned gradients were also key considerations 
				that needed to be incorporated into the design.
				A tank locomotive design was also preferable since the journeys were relatively short, and the work would involve frequent changes in direction.
